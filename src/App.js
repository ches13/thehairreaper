          The Hair Reaper provides lace/wig revamp and reconstruction services
          as well as. Most wig revamps require <strong>Hair Ventilation</strong>
          .
        </p>
        <p className="center">
          The term <strong>Hair Ventilation</strong> means a method of affixing
          individual strands of hair into a wig cap base or lace. This method is
          very tedious and time consuming. Contingent to its prolonged process;
          pricing for this service will vary (Starting at $70 dollars and can go
          up to $150 dollars). Pricing is determined by the amount of hair that
          is missing from the closure/frontal, as well as labor. Unfortunately,
          this does not include styling! If the client will like styling that
          will be an additional $25.{" "}
